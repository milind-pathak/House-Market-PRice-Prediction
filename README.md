# House-Market-Price-Prediction (Big Data with Machine Learning)

Folder Structure-

Code Files - We have divided the codes in two parts. We trained models for both USA and California and we have two separate codes as well as datasets.
a.	Entire USA - This folder contains Results, Dataset and Codes for the models we trained for the entire USA. This is a python file and in order to execute it, you will need to write a command in Terminal - python3 house_market.py 
b.	California - This folder contains the Results, Dataset and Codes for this approach. We have added both, the python file and the ipynb file which was downloaded from Colab.
In order to run the Python file same python3 command as shown above can be used - python3 House_CA_EDA.py
If you want to use Colab, upload the ipynb file to Colab and use the Run All option. This will run all the cells and show the output.
Also, if you open the ipynb file in Colab or Visual Studio Code, you will be able to view the results of each query without running the cells as we have saved the outputs in that file.
